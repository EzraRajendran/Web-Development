A Toast Notification is a small, unobtrusive popup message that briefly appears on the screen to provide feedback or updates. There are four different types of toast notifications, each triggered by specific buttons. For example, clicking “Submit” triggers a green “Success” toast, with each type featuring its own CSS animations. JavaScript controls how long the toast remains visible. Commonly used for alerts or confirmations, these notifications automatically fade out after a few seconds. You can easily create them using basic HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
